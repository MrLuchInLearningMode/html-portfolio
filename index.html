    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a gifted pencil analyst. I have studied pencils across the planet and take great pride in my ability to take those pencils and really, fully, properly determine the sort of wood, graphite, metal, and rubber that has been used to create itâ€”in addition to whatever has been applied for the markings on the side. If you have any pencil-related tasks that you would like me to assist with, then by all means, just let me know.</p>
